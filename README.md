# DSA Practice in JavaScript

This repository is your dedicated workspace for honing your Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) skills in JavaScript. Here, you'll implement various data structures and algorithms, explore their applications in solving problems, and solidify your understanding through practice.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of JavaScript fundamentals (variables, data types, loops, conditionals, functions)

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Node.js and npm:** Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed. Visit https://nodejs.org/ for installation instructions.
2. **Code Editor or IDE:** Choose a code editor or IDE of your preference, such as Visual Studio Code, WebStorm, or Sublime Text.
3. **Create a Project Directory:** In your chosen development environment, create a new project directory to store your DSA practice code.

## Directory Structure

Here's a recommended directory structure to keep your code organized:

- Create a directory for each data structure and algorithm you'll implement (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hashmaps, sliding window, graphs, etc.).
- Within each directory, create separate files for:
    - `implementation.js`: Contains the code for implementing the data structure or algorithm.
    - `applications.js`: Discusses common applications of the data structure or algorithm in JavaScript.
    - `problems/`: A subdirectory for storing practice problems of varying difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard).

## Your Progress

You've already covered a great foundation:

- Arrays
- Stacks
- Hashmaps
- Sliding Window
- Graphs
- Linked Lists

Feel free to add additional directories for any other data structures or algorithms you explore.

## Contributing

- This repository is intended for your personal DSA practice.
- Create branches for experimentation or different approaches to problems.
- Document your learning journey and thought processes in comments within your code.
- Consider creating a public repository on GitHub if you'd like to share your solutions with others (optional).
